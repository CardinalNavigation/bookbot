# Boot.Dev Project: BookBot 
Book bot is a simple Python program that takes in a txt file.
The program:
1. Searches the file, 
2. Pulls the text out of the file
3. Creates a dictionary of letters and counts the occurance of each letter
4. Moves this dictionary into an List(Array) ranked from highest to lowest

After Action Report (AAR):
* I had to go back and re-learn some dictionary methods.
    In particular I had to do some work to figure out how to loop over the dictionary and move the pieces looped over into a list. 
* Working with Lists feels very intuitive, likely from practice with Javascript.
* The sort function can take two parameters, which direction the list is sorted
